# Deploy the HTTP proxy configurator charm

This tutorial will walk you through deploying and configuring the HTTP proxy configurator operator, a Juju charm that provides HTTP proxy configuration to your application. For the purpose of the tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use the charm in `pass-through` mode.

## What you'll need

Before you start, you'll need:

- A machine with amd64 architecture.
- A Juju controller (version 3.0 or higher)
- MicroK8s / Canonical Kubernetes and LXD installed and bootstrapped to Juju.

[note]
All the requirements can be met using the [Multipass charm-dev blueprint](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-your-deployment/manage-your-deployment-environment/#set-things-up). Use the Multipass VM shell to run all commands in this tutorial.

For more information about how to install Juju, see [Get started with Juju](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/tutorial/).

## Set up tutorial models

To easily clean up the resources and to separate your workload from the contents of this tutorial,
set up a new Juju model in the `lxd` controller to deploy a HTTP proxy provider.

```bash
juju add-model proxy-tutorial-lxd
```

Set up a new Juju model in the `microk8s` controller to deploy a HTTP proxy requirer.

```bash
juju switch <k8s-controller-name>
juju add-model proxy-tutorial-k8s
```
## Deploy the charms

<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = NO -->
### Deploy a proxy requirer
<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

We'll use the Hockeypuck charm. Follow the [Hockeypuck](https://charmhub.io/hockeypuck-k8s/docs/tutorial-getting-started) tutorial to deploy the Hockeypuck charm.

### Deploy a proxy provider

We'll use the squid-forward-proxy operator:

```bash
juju switch <lxd-controller-name>
juju deploy squid-forward-proxy --channel edge
```

Wait for the deployment to complete:

```bash
juju status --watch 1s
```

You should see the squid-forward-proxy in an active state.

### Deploy the HTTP proxy configurator

Deploy the HTTP proxy configurator charm:

```bash
juju switch <k8s-controller-name>
juju deploy http-proxy-configurator
```

Configure the domains that applications will access through the proxy:

```bash
juju config http-proxy-configurator http-proxy-domains="api.github.com,example.com"
```

Establish the relation between the configurator and the proxy provider:

```bash
juju integrate http-proxy-configurator:http-proxy <lxd-controller-name>:admin/proxy-tutorial-lxd.squid-forward-proxy:http-proxy
```

### Test proxy

You can now test if the proxy values have been received by the proxy requirer charm:

```bash
juju ssh hockeypuck-k8s/0 "pebble plan" | grep "PROXY"
```
This must be the same as the values obtained from the Squid proxy charm:

```bash
juju run http-proxy-configurator/0 get-proxies
```

### Clean up the environment

Congratulations! You have successfully finished the tutorial. You can now remove the
model environment that youâ€™ve created using the following command.


```bash
juju destroy-model proxy-tutorial-k8s --destroy-storage
juju switch <lxd-controller-name>
juju destroy-model proxy-tutorial-lxd --destroy-storage
```
